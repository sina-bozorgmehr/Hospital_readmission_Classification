One of the industries that demands a well-prepared perspective based on scientific data collected daily from the industry, especially from patients, is health care. In this industry, predicting is a key aspect of data analysis. The rate of readmission is one of the challenges that hospitals and the medical industry are dealing with. According to Hosp. Readmission Reduction | CMS (2020) readmission defines as:
“Unplanned readmissions that happen within 30 days of discharge from the index (i.e., initial) admission.
Patients who are readmitted to the same hospital, or another applicable acute care hospital for any reason”.
This is such a significant issue that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) penalizes hospitals that have a high readmission rate. According to federal data, nearly half of the country's hospitals will receive decreased payments for all Medicare patients due to a history of readmitting patients, many of which are still dealing with the financial consequences from the COVID-19 pandemic (Medicare Fines Half of Hospitals for Readmitting Too Many Patients, 2020). Hospitals must be prepared for this issue and avoid penalties by anticipating the rate of readmission and implementing relevant actions.
